Filipino Family Communication Adapter
A web-based tool designed to help bridge communication gaps between generations in Filipino-American families, particularly for elderly relatives who may have hearing difficulties, mild dementia, autism spectrum traits, or cultural/linguistic differences.
🎯 Purpose
This tool transforms American English communication patterns into culturally appropriate, cognitively accessible Filipino family communication styles. It's specifically designed for:

Cultural adaptation: Converting indirect American communication to respectful Filipino family styles
Cognitive accessibility: Simplifying complex requests for individuals with dementia or autism spectrum traits
Hearing accommodation: Providing visual formats for those with hearing difficulties
Cross-generational understanding: Bridging communication gaps between Filipino immigrants and their American-born family members

✨ Features
Four Communication Styles:

Direct & Respectful: Adds Filipino respectful markers ("Tatay," "po," "Salamat") while making requests clear and direct
Visual Schedule Format: Converts time-based requests into concrete, numbered steps
Simple Commands: Breaks complex requests into single, clear actions
Whiteboard Format: Creates visual-friendly versions with icons and clear formatting

Cultural Adaptations:

Automatic integration of Filipino respectful language
Conversion of indirect American phrasing to direct statements
